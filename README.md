## Project Overview

This is an app using to track marketing refferal links. The solution is front-end focused using html, css, javascript and Vue.js. I chose to use Vue.js because that is the framework that I have the most experience with. I set up each refferal link, the refferal list and the form as different components. I set up the initial links as an array and passed that array to the referral list as a property, which was looped through to list out each link. The form adds a new link to the link array. I also used v-show to display the correct page. 

## Some goals that I wish I would have accomplished: 
- I started by building in React, but decided to switch to Vue since I am more familar. I would have liked to build the app in React. 
- I had trouble getting the data (Link name and Link Count) to stay updated when routing to a new page. Because of this I switched from using routing to using v-show. With v-show I was unable to get the url to display '/landing/?link={link_title}'.

## Show us your other projects! (optional)

This project gave me the opportunity to work on project set up and deployment, which isn't something I often work on! Since project serving and hosting isnt something I work with often, it took more time then expected. Because of that I was not able to include some of the animation, UI and design elements of small components that I often work on.
