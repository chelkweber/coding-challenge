## Show us your other projects! (optional)

This project gave me the opportunity to work on project set up and deployment, which isn't something I often work on! Since project serving and hosting isnt something I work with often, it took more time then expected. Because of that I was not able to include some of the animation, UI and design elements of small components that I often work on.
