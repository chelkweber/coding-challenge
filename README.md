## Project Overview

This is an app using to track marketing refferal links. The solution is front-end focused using html, css, javascript and Vue.js. I chose to use Vue.js because that is the framework that I have the most experience with. I set up each refferal link, the refferal list and the form as different components. I set up the initial links as an array and passed that array to the referral list as a property, which was looped through to list out each link. The form adds a new link to the link array. I also set up router using Vue Router, which displays the Main component on the homepage and the Landing component at /landing. 

## Some goals that I wish I would have accomplished: 
- I started by building in React, but decided to switch to Vue since I am more familar. I would have liked to build the app in React. 
- I had trouble getting the data (Link name and Link Count) to stay updated when routing to a new page. I was able to keep the count updated by adding a target=blank to the link, but was unable to get the Landing Page to have the current link name.
- I would have liked to add some animations and enhanced UI/UX features with more time. 
- I also had trouble updating my heroku so the most recent commit is not deployed.

## Show us your other projects! (optional)

This project gave me the opportunity to work on project set up and deployment, which isn't something I often work on! Since project serving and hosting isnt something I work with often, it took more time then expected. Because of that I was not able to include some of the animation, UI and design elements of small components that I often work on.
